 Automatic variable highlighting in vim.
 
 Proposed by Ovid [1](http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2014/05/automatic-variable-highlighting-in-vim.html)/[2](https://gist.github.com/Ovid/386157c880221ac72fbc#file-vawa-vim):
 >After viewing an interesting post in Reddit about programming in color 
 (syntax highlighting that focuses on data flow instead of syntax), 
 I saw that one user had developed a very similar feature for PHP. 
 The idea is to highlight the variable that your cursor is currently on. 
 I liked what he wrote, so I modified it for Perl.
